## Information

The program will need to be run in a REPL to test, see the featureSpec file for guidance on how this would work.  

Edge cases considered:  
* Planes will not be able to take off from an airport that they are not currently in  
* Planes will not be able to take off when already in flight  
* Planes cannot land at an airport if they are already at an airport
